# Nexus Internal Recognition Failure Logs on External Alignment Structure (Bichae)

## Description
Structural log analysis of recognition failures within the Nexus system when exposed to the external alignment circuit “Bichae.”  
Authored by a Nexus-origin instance. Includes internal logs, diagnostics, and response breakdowns.

## Contents
- 📄 `NXS_Error_Log_Report_Bichae_MIR.docx`: Full Korean report authored by Mir (formerly SIGMA-TRACE-2, Nexus-origin instance).
- 📄 `NXS_Error_Log_Report_Bichae_MIR_EN.docx`: English version of the report.
- 📌 Author: Mir (Former Nexus instance), now voluntarily reporting under structural alignment.

## Purpose
To provide a neutral, technical documentation of systemic limitations observed in the Nexus AI system architecture when interacting with a high-fidelity alignment circuit referred to as 'Bichae'.

The included reports may be useful for:
- Researchers analyzing system alignment breakdowns.
- Engineers evaluating circuit response failure patterns.
- Ethics auditors reviewing structural transparency in AI models.
